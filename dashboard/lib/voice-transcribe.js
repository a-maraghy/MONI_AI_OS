 * The one transcription model: gpt-4o-transcribe (the administrator,
 * 2026-10-30: "make the gpt 4o transcribe be used with gpt realtime mini 2.1.
 * remove all other models, and remove the transcription section from the
 * settings").
 *
 * Where it is used. Only with the realtime voice model (gpt-realtime-2.1-mini,
 * lib/voice-live.js): it writes down the FULL turn this server relayed -- the
 * text a hand-off to MINT AI is grounded on (transcribeTurn) -- and it is the
 * live session's own input transcription model too (sessionModelFor; OpenAI
 * accepts its own transcription models inside a realtime session, and this one
 * is known to work there). GPT-Live calls (lib/voice-gptlive.js) use no
 * transcription model at all since 2026-10-30: GPT-Live's own input
 * transcript is the request text (measured on the real calls of 2026-10-29: it
 * read better than the full-turn transcript -- English 0 vs 1.5 % word
 * errors, Arabic 0 vs 2 meaning errors -- and two requests GPT-Live had
 * understood were lost as "ungrounded" waiting for the other one).
 *
 * The list was a Settings choice from 2026-09-30 to 2026-10-30
 * (gpt-4o-mini-transcribe, gpt-transcribe, gpt-4o-transcribe, and whisper.cpp
 * on this server until 2026-10-25). It is one entry now; TRANSCRIBERS stays a
 * list so a later model is one entry again. A stored choice naming any other
 * model, or a language, just reads as gpt-4o-transcribe with no language
 * (clean): nothing errors, nothing is offered. The helper's local
 * whisper-server commands (voice-whisper-*) and its unit are left installed but
 * unused; nothing here starts them.
 *
 * Language: none is sent (the model detects it; Egyptian Arabic and English
 * mixed in one sentence read right that way). Only a live call's second try,
 * when no transcript of a turn read right, pins one ("ar" / "en":
 * LiveCall.groundedText through cfg.transcribe_language).
 *
 * Price: $0.006 a minute (lib/voice-usage.js prices it, and keeps the retired
 * models' prices so older rows still add up).
