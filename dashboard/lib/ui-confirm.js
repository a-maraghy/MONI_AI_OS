/**
 * UI control, Phase 3: the Tier-2 screen actions (theme.set, persona.set,
 * voice.set) wait for the administrator's own confirm, which this server checks.
 *
 * When the voice (or MINT AI) asks for one, open() records it for that user --
 * one at a time, for 30 s -- and the page shows a confirm chip. It is applied
 * only after:
 *   (a) a click on Confirm, or
 *   (b) the administrator's NEXT utterance, as this server transcribed it
 *       (never a model's words), being a whole "yes" (public/voice-stop.js
 *       yes(): "yes", "go ahead", «أيوه», «اعملها»...). heard() marks it
 *       confirmed and the page is told.
 * In both cases the page then calls take(), which hands the entry over once;
 * the page applies it through the existing, CSRF'd, permission-checked route.
 * A "no" cancels it; any other utterance cancels it too (the next turn has
 * moved on), and so does the 30 s expiry. Nothing here writes a setting.
 *
 * The 30 s run from when the voice has finished asking (arm(), called by the
 * live call once its voice is quiet), not from the ask itself. Expiry is not
 * silent: onExpire(actor, entry) is called once when an entry runs out
 * unanswered, so the server can audit it, update the chip and tell the voice.
