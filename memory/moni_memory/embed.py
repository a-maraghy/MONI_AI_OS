"""Local text embeddings.

Deliberately local-only: an agent's memory is the most sensitive thing it holds,
so it is never sent to a third party to be embedded. fastembed runs a small
quantised ONNX model on CPU -- roughly 40ms for a query on this box, and the
model (~130MB) is downloaded once into a cache shared by every agent.
