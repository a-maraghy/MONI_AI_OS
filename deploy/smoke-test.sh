# Release procedure

## Steps

We ship on Thursdays. Tag the commit, wait for the pipeline to go green, then
promote the build to production. Never promote on a Friday: nobody is around to
roll it back over the weekend.

## Rollback

Rollback is `promote --to previous`, which takes about ninety seconds.
