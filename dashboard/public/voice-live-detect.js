/*
 * Live conversation: is the administrator REALLY talking over the
 * voice, or is the microphone only hearing the speaker? Pure, no DOM, no
 * audio APIs: public/voice-live.js feeds it the microphone's level (20 ms
 * frames, after the browser's echo cancelling) and the player's output level,
 * and it says "on" once there has been sustained voice above what the
 * speaker's leak explains, "off" when that voice has stopped. The server
 * (lib/voice-live.js) interrupts only when this AND its own VAD agree.
 *
 *   var d = MintLiveDetect.create(opts?)
 *   d.out(level, playing, tMs)   the player's level (every ~100 ms and on changes)
 *   d.mic(level, tMs) -> "on" | "off" | null
 *   d.snapshot()                 { floor, leak, threshold, voiced, playing, sincePlay }
 *
 * The rule, while the voice is audible (and for `tailMs` after):
 *   threshold = max(floorK x noise floor + floorAdd, outK x output level x leak)
 *   "on" once the microphone has been above it for `holdMs` in total within the
 *   last `windowMs` (people barge in choppily: "wait, stop, never mind" is
 *   250 ms, a pause, 300 ms...), never in the first `warmMs` of a playback
 *   segment -- that is when the leak
 *   (microphone level / output level) is measured, for the rest of the call.
 * The noise floor is learned while nothing plays. Same idea as the hands-free
 * mode's guard in moni-ai.js (ignore the start, several times the floor, held).
 *
 * Works in the page (window.MintLiveDetect) and in node (module.exports), so
 * tools/test-voice-live.cjs drives the very same code.
