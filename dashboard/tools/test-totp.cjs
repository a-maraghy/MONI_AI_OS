/* --------------------------------------------------- the clock keeps moving --

 * to assign `epoch` on the shared otplib instance and then try to put the old
 * options back. It could not -- the setter merges, and the getter's snapshot
 * has no key to clear with -- so the clock stayed pinned to the moment of the
 * last accepted code for the life of the process. The first code after a
 * restart worked and every later one was refused, which from the outside looked
 * exactly like "signing in works, unlocking root a minute later does not".
 *
 * Every test above passes with that bug present, because none of them lets any
 * time pass. These two do: one checks the invariant directly, and one waits for
 * a real thirty-second boundary and offers the code a phone would be showing.
