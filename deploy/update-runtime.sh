# Pull the agent runtime and put the new code into the venv the agents actually
# run from.
#
#   sudo bash /opt/moni-ai-os/deploy/update-runtime.sh
#
# The step that is easy to miss: the runtime is pip-installed into the venv as a
# *copy*, not as an editable install, so `git pull` alone changes nothing that
# is running. The agents keep executing the old code out of site-packages, the
# unit restarts cleanly, the logs look healthy, and the change simply is not
# there. Reinstalling is what makes a pull take effect.
#
# Restarting every agent is part of this rather than left to the operator, for
# the same reason: an agent that is still up is still running the old code.
#
# Options:
#   --only <agent-slug>   restart only moni-agent@<agent-slug> (if it is running);
#                         the others keep the old code until their next restart
#   --no-restart          restart nothing; every agent picks the new code up at
#                         its next restart (e.g. a channel save in the panel)
# Without either, every running agent is restarted, as before.
