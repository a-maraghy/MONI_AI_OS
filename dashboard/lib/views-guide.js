    <section id="voice" class="card gd">
      <h2>Talking to MINT AI</h2>
      ${where("MINT AI › Settings › Voice")}
      <div class="gd-body">
      <p>Voice is one thing: a <b>live conversation</b>. Press the microphone in the Command
        Center or the dock and just talk; MINT AI answers at once and you can interrupt it.
        It speaks as MINT AI, in the first person, and what it reports is read from MINT AI's
        own results — the voice itself cannot run anything.</p>
      <p>Only <b>administrators</b> may talk by voice: it takes the permission <b>Talk with
        MINT AI by voice</b> (<code>voice.use</code>), which no other built-in role has.
        Changing the voice settings is a separate permission.</p>
      <h3>Turning it on</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Open <b>Settings › Voice</b>. Switch <b>Voice</b> to <b>Enabled</b>.</li>
        <li>Add the <b>Voice API token</b> (an OpenAI key). It is written to a root-only file
          and never shown again; <b>Replace</b> and <b>Remove</b> are next to it, and
          <b>Test</b> speaks one line and transcribes it back.</li>
        <li>Check the <b>Voice model</b> and pick a <b>voice</b> — each card says whether it
          sounds female, male or neutral.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>One voice model</h3>
      <p>A single model does the voice: it holds the live conversation and reads MINT AI's
        replies aloud, word for word. Only models that passed both on the real API are
        offered — today <b>GPT Realtime 2.1 mini</b>. What you say is also written down by a
        transcription model paired with it (<b>gpt-4o-mini-transcribe</b>); MINT AI always
        acts on that transcript, never on the voice model's retelling of your words. The
        transcription model is fixed, not a setting.</p>
      <h3>During a call</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Say “stop listening”, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> or the red <b>End</b> to finish. A call
          lasts at most 20 minutes; one call at a time.</li>
        <li><b>Speakers mode</b> (default) pauses the microphone while MINT AI speaks — tap,
          <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Esc</kbd> to interrupt. With headphones, <b>Headphones
          mode</b> lets you talk over it.</li>
        <li>Arabic: it follows how you speak, or the <b>Arabic persona</b> you pick in
          Settings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Read replies aloud</b> reads typed replies in the same voice.</p>
      <h3>Turning it off</h3>
      <p>Switching <b>Voice</b> to <b>Disabled</b> turns off all voice for everyone — live
        calls, read-aloud and every voice control. The token stays stored, so switching it
        back on needs nothing else.</p>

      <h2>Hiring and retiring sessions</h2>
      ${where("Agents & sessions › Sessions · MINT AI › Settings › Sessions & hiring")}
      <div class="gd-body">
      <p>MINT AI may <b>hire</b> a worker session on its own when a job needs one — by
        default up to 7 live sessions and 3 hires an hour. Both limits are editable in
        <b>Settings › Sessions &amp; hiring</b>. A hired session runs as its own service,
        survives restarts, and its first message is marked as coming from MINT AI.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Keep</b> a hired session to make it permanent: MINT AI will never retire
          it.</li>
        <li><b>Retire</b> ends it gracefully; its transcript is kept. MINT AI may <i>ask</i>
          to retire one — a Decision card — but retiring always needs your consent: only you
          can say yes.</li>
        <li>Your own sessions (started by you) are never hired, kept or retired by MINT
          AI.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every tool a hired session runs passes the same destructive-action gate; anything

      <h2>Screen control</h2>
      ${where("MINT AI › Settings › Screen control")}
      <div class="gd-body">
      <p>When you ask, MINT AI can act on your screen: end or mute a call, open a panel,
        switch the core, show the last reply, or take you to any page. These happen at once
        with a note and a 60-second <b>Undo</b>. Changing a preference — the theme, the voice
        persona or the voice — always asks you first. It never clicks anything on a page for
        you, and approving stays yours. <b>Allow screen actions</b> switches all of this off
        for you.</p>
      <h3>The page map</h3>
      <p>MINT AI can open any page, section, tab or anchor in the <b>page map</b> — this
        guide's sections included. The map is built from the source itself; <b>Rescan
        pages</b> rebuilds it and shows what is new, renamed or removed. Each entry has an
        allow switch, and <b>New entries</b> decides whether newly found ones are allowed at
        once (the default) or wait for you. MINT AI only ever sees entries your role may
        open.</p>

    <section id="budget" class="card gd">
      <h2>Budgets and token caps</h2>
      ${where("MINT AI › Settings › Usage & budget")}
      <div class="gd-body">
      <p>The budget is counted in tokens. Each session has a <b>daily token cap</b> — MINT
        AI, every hired or kept session, your own sessions, and a default that each new hire
        copies. The bar shows today's use against the cap, with the warning line (<b>Warn
        at</b>, 80 % by default).</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Warn</b> — a Decision card tells you the cap was passed; the session keeps
          going.</li>
        <li><b>Pause</b> — the session stops at the end of its current step and takes no new
          work until you <b>Resume</b> it or the day turns (Cairo time). When MINT AI itself
          is paused it holds every new turn, your own messages included. Raising the cap above
          today's use also releases it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Pause</b> is only for MINT AI and hired or kept sessions. Your own sessions were
        not started by MINT AI and it has no hold on them, so they can only warn.</p>
      <h3>What counts, and when it is checked</h3>
      <p>A cap counts <b>all</b> tokens — input, output and cache — the same “N tok today”
        figure the Usage panel shows. Caps are checked at the end of every MINT AI turn and
        after each cost scan, so a session other than MINT AI can run past its cap by up to
        one cost-scan interval before it is warned or paused.</p>

      <p>MINT AI waits up to 300 seconds for an approval before refusing. <b>Rules</b>
        pre-answer common requests (allow, ask or deny). <b>Watchers</b> tell MINT AI when a
        service fails, bans burst, the disk fills, an agent keeps failing or Odoo errors pile
        up. <b>Standing orders</b> run on a schedule — the <b>Morning briefing</b> at 07:30 is

      <h2>Telegram agents</h2>
      ${where("Agents & sessions › Telegram agents · Channels · Add-ons")}
      <div class="gd-body">
      <p>An <b>agent</b> is a Claude session with its own workspace and memory; a
        <b>channel</b> is how people reach it (a Telegram bot, or a linked WhatsApp number).
        To make one: create a Telegram bot with BotFather, find your Telegram user ID, then
        <b>New agent</b> — the mind first, then its channel. Only listed users are answered.
        One channel per agent; swapping the channel keeps the agent's memory. Add-ons (voice
        notes, files, …) are switched per agent and per channel. Groups with topics, WhatsApp
        and broadcast channels are covered below.</p>

      <div class="gd-sub" id="how">
      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>Two things, kept separate, and nothing is shared between agents.</p>
      <pre class="diagram">You, on Telegram or WhatsApp

      ▼
  channel                   the credential and the allow-list live here

      │
      └─ memory MCP server ─▶ vault (Markdown) + vectors (local embeddings)</pre>
      <p class="muted">Four things follow from this shape, and they are the ones worth
        remembering:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No inbound port.</strong> Both transports connect outbound, so the
          firewall stays shut. Nothing about an agent is reachable from the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>Only files survive.</strong> A chat session ends on timeout or
          <code>/new</code>. Whatever the agent did not write to its vault is gone.</li>
        <li><strong>One channel per agent.</strong> Telegram allows exactly one poller per
          token; two agents sharing a channel would make both drop messages at random, so
          the panel refuses it.</li>
        <li><strong>The channel is not the agent.</strong> Swap the bot, or move it to
          WhatsApp, and the agent keeps every word of its memory.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="gd-sub" id="bot">
      <h3>1 · Create a Telegram bot</h3>
      <p>Every agent needs its own bot. This takes about a minute.</p>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>Open Telegram and message <a href="https://t.me/botfather"><code>@BotFather</code></a>.</li>
        <li>Send <code>/newbot</code>.</li>
        <li>Give it a display name (anything, e.g. <em>Odoo Dev</em>).</li>
        <li>Give it a username. It must be unique and end in <code>bot</code> —
          e.g. <code>moni_odoo_dev_bot</code>.</li>
        <li>BotFather replies with a token that looks like
          <code class="mono">8123456789:AAHk9x…</code>. That line is the bot. Copy it.</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="alert warn">The token is a password. Anyone holding it controls the bot
        and can read everything sent to it. Paste it into the add-channel form and nowhere
        else — not into a chat, not into a file. The panel stores it <code>0600</code> and
        never displays it again. If you ever leak one, <code>/revoke</code> in BotFather
        invalidates it immediately.</div>
      <p><b>Worth setting while you are there:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>/setdescription</code> — shown on the bot's empty chat screen.</li>
        <li><code>/setuserpic</code> — makes agents distinguishable at a glance when you
          run several.</li>
        <li><code>/setprivacy</code> → <em>Disable</em> — only if you plan to use the bot in
          a group and want it to see all messages rather than only replies and mentions.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="gd-sub" id="userid">
      <h3>2 · Find your Telegram user ID</h3>
      <p>The agent answers a whitelist of numeric user IDs and ignores everyone else. An
        agent with an empty whitelist talks to nobody — that is the safe default, not a bug.</p>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>Message <a href="https://t.me/userinfobot"><code>@userinfobot</code></a> on Telegram.</li>
        <li>It replies with your ID — a number like <code class="mono">123456789</code>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="muted">Adding a colleague later is the same trick: they message that bot,
        send you the number, you add it to the channel's allowed list.</p>

      <div class="gd-sub" id="create">
      <h3>3 · Create the agent and its channel</h3>
      <p>These are two separate things, on purpose. The <strong>agent</strong> is the mind:
        its brief, its workspace, its memory. The <strong>channel</strong> is how people
        reach it: a bot token, a list of who may talk to it. Keeping them apart means you
        can swap the bot an agent answers on, or move it to WhatsApp, without rebuilding
        the agent or losing a word of its memory.</p>
      <p><b>First the agent</b> — <a href="/agents/new">Telegram agents › New agent</a>:</p>

        <tr><td>Display name</td><td class="muted">What you call it. Cosmetic.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Short name</td><td class="muted">Lowercase, becomes the folder and the

        <tr><td>Role</td><td class="muted">The standing brief, written into CLAUDE.md and
          loaded on every request. This is the field that decides whether the agent is
          useful. Be specific about what it owns, what it may do unattended, and what it
          must ask about first.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Project directory</td><td class="muted">Optional. An existing folder under
          <code>/opt/projects</code>, <code>/srv</code> or
          <code>/opt/moni-agents/workspaces</code>. It appears inside the vault as
          <code>project/</code>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Add-ons</td><td class="muted">What the agent can do — git, scheduled jobs,
          webhooks. Memory is always on.</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p><b>Then the channel</b> — <a href="/channels/new">Channels › Add channel</a>:</p>
      <table class="kv">
        <tr><td>Type</td><td class="muted">Telegram or WhatsApp.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Bot token</td><td class="muted">From step 1. Verified with Telegram before
          anything is written, so a mistyped token fails here rather than in the logs.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Allowed user IDs</td><td class="muted">From step 2. Empty means nobody.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Connect to agent</td><td class="muted">The agent you just made.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Add-ons</td><td class="muted">What it can receive — voice notes, files,
          images — and how replies feel.</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>On save the panel writes the agent's environment, enables a systemd unit and
        starts it. An agent with no channel stays stopped rather than crash-looping.</p>
      <div class="alert info">A good role brief beats every other setting. "You maintain the
        Odoo 19 instance at /opt/projects/odoo; you may edit modules and run tests
        unattended; ask before restarting the service during working hours" produces a far
        better agent than "You are a helpful assistant".</div>

      <div class="gd-sub" id="talk">
      <h3>4 · Talk to it</h3>
      <p>Open <code class="mono">https://t.me/&lt;your_bot_username&gt;</code>, press Start,

      <div class="gd-sub" id="addons">
      <h3>Add-ons</h3>
      <p>An add-on is a capability with a switch, not a plugin you install. Turning one on

      <p><b>Files.</b> Send a spreadsheet, a PDF, a Word document, a photo, a CSV. The file is
        saved into the agent's workspace under <code>attachments/inbox/</code> and the agent
        gets the path, so it can open a spreadsheet with pandas or pull the text out of a PDF
        — and it is still there tomorrow if you want to ask a follow-up question.</p>

      <h3>Groups &amp; topics</h3>
      <p>Default is a private chat: you and one agent. Group topic mode instead puts the

        people work with the same agent, or one agent covers several projects.</p>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>In Telegram, create a <strong>group</strong> (not a channel).</li>

        <li>Get the group's chat ID: forward any message from the group to
          <a href="https://t.me/userinfobot"><code>@userinfobot</code></a>, or temporarily add
          <code>@RawDataBot</code>. Supergroup IDs start with <code class="mono">-100</code>.</li>
        <li>In the agent's Settings, tick <em>Route conversations into group topics</em> and
          paste that ID. The panel checks the group is a forum and the bot is an admin
          before saving, and tells you exactly what is missing if not.</li>

      <div class="alert warn">Group privacy mode is on by default, so the bot only sees
        messages that mention it or reply to it. That is usually what you want in a busy

        Settings → Group Privacy → Turn off, then remove and re-add the bot for the change

      <h3>WhatsApp</h3>
      <p>A WhatsApp channel links a real number the way WhatsApp Web does: you scan a QR
        code from your phone, and the server holds the linked-device session. The agent
        behind it is the same agent — same workspace, same memory, same voice and file
        handling — reached over a different transport.</p>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>Install the bridge once:
          <code>sudo bash /opt/moni-ai-os/deploy/install-whatsapp.sh</code></li>
        <li><a href="/channels/new">Channels › Add channel</a>, pick WhatsApp, name it, and
          connect it to an agent.</li>
        <li>Add the numbers allowed to talk to it, in international format.</li>
        <li>Press <strong>Start linking</strong>, then on your phone:
          <strong>WhatsApp → Settings → Linked devices → Link a device</strong> and scan
          the code. It expires after about a minute; reload for a fresh one.</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="alert warn">WhatsApp has no official API for this. The bridge uses an
        unofficial library, which is against WhatsApp's terms of service, and the number
        <strong>can be banned without warning</strong>. Use a number you can afford to
        lose, not your main business line.</div>
      <p class="muted small">A WhatsApp channel with no agent connected does not run at
        all — collecting messages with nothing to answer them is worse than being visibly
        off. Group chats are ignored by design.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="gd-sub" id="channels">
      <h3>Telegram broadcast channels</h3>
      <p class="muted">Not to be confused with a Mint OS <em>channel</em>, which is any way of
        reaching an agent. This is Telegram's own broadcast feature.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A bot added to a channel as admin <strong>can post</strong> to it.</li>
        <li>Channel subscribers cannot reply in a way the bot receives, so there is no
          conversation to have. An agent in a channel can only talk, never listen.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So: use a <strong>private chat</strong> for a personal agent, a <strong>group with
        topics</strong> for a shared one, and a <strong>channel</strong> only as a
        notification feed. If you want an agent to broadcast — deploy notices, nightly
        summaries, CI results — add its bot to the channel as an admin with post rights and
        give it the channel ID in its role brief; it will post there when asked, while
        continuing to take instructions from you in private.</p>

      <h2>Memory</h2>
      ${where("Agents & sessions › Memory · each Telegram agent's page")}
      <div class="gd-body">
      <p>Two kinds. <b>Claude Code's memory</b> on this machine — every conversation,
        searchable, plus curated facts — is under <b>Memory</b>: search it, add, edit or
        forget a fact, read a past session. Each <b>Telegram agent</b> has its own vault
        (Markdown files and a vector index) on its page; press Reindex if search finds
        nothing.</p>

      <div class="gd-sub" id="vault">
      <h3>A Telegram agent's vault</h3>
      <p>A Telegram session dies on timeout, restart, or <code>/new</code>. Nothing in the
        conversation survives it. Files do. Every agent therefore gets a vault:</p>
      <table class="kv">
        <tr><td><code>CLAUDE.md</code></td><td class="muted">Identity and standing rules.
          Injected into the system prompt every request. Edit it on the agent's page under
          <em>Instructions</em>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><code>MEMORY.md</code></td><td class="muted">Current state plus an index of
          every note. Also injected every request — so it is the map, not the territory.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><code>memory/*.md</code></td><td class="muted">One durable fact per file,
          linked with <code>[[wikilinks]]</code>. The substance.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><code>WORKLOG.md</code></td><td class="muted">Dated narrative of what was
          done.</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p><b>The vector index.</b> MEMORY.md cannot hold everything — it is in the prompt, so
        it has a budget. The notes it points at are indexed instead: each is chunked by
        heading, embedded with a small model running <strong>on this machine</strong>, and
        stored in a per-agent SQLite database. The agent searches it with a
        <code>memory_search</code> tool before answering anything that depends on prior
        work.</p>
      <p class="muted">Search is hybrid — vector similarity for paraphrase ("how do we
        deploy" finding "release procedure"), keyword matching for the exact tokens
        embeddings lose (error codes, flag names, IDs) — and the two rankings are merged.
        The files are the source of truth; the index is a cache you can delete and rebuild
        with the Reindex button at any time. Nothing is sent anywhere to be embedded.</p>
      <p><b>Curating it.</b> Memory rots if nobody prunes it. The single highest-value
        maintenance action is correcting a wrong note — an agent that keeps repeating a
        mistake is usually reading a stale memory, and fixing that one file fixes the
        behaviour permanently. Do it on the agent's page under <em>Memory</em>, or in
        Obsidian.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="gd-sub" id="obsidian">
      <h3>Obsidian</h3>
      <p>Every vault is a real Obsidian vault — backlinks, graph view, search, the lot.
        Obsidian is installed on this server's desktop, so the quickest way in is over RDP.
        RDP is not exposed to the internet; tunnel it over SSH first:</p>
      <pre>ssh -N -L 13389:127.0.0.1:3389 ubuntu@${ssh}</pre>
      <p>Then point Remote Desktop at <code class="mono">127.0.0.1:13389</code>, log in, and
        open Obsidian. Each agent's vault is at:</p>
      <pre>/opt/moni-agents/agents/&lt;agent&gt;/vault</pre>
      <p class="muted">Open several as separate vaults and switch between them, or open
        <code>/opt/moni-agents/agents</code> as one vault to see every agent's memory in a
        single graph.</p>
      <p class="muted small">Editing notes by hand is expected and safe. The agent re-reads
        files on its next search; you never need to tell it you changed something.</p>
