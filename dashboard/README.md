# Dashboard

The web panel. Node, server-rendered HTML, no client framework, no external
assets — the CSP blocks them, and a panel that can grant SSH access is the last
place to be pulling scripts off a CDN.

Architecture, security model and deployment: see the [repository README](../README.md)
and [docs/agents.md](../docs/agents.md).

## Layout

    server.js              routes, auth, sessions, CSRF
    lib/db.js              SQLite: admin account, pairing codes, devices, login log
    lib/priv.js            wrapper that shells out to the privileged helper
    lib/ui.js              shared page chrome and formatting
    lib/views.js           system pages (overview, keys, devices, audit)
    lib/views-agents.js    agent management pages
    lib/views-guide.js     the operator's manual, served from the panel
    lib/views-claude.js    Claude Code: memory, sessions, running processes
    lib/telegram.js        Bot API client, used only to validate configuration
    public/style.css       styles
    public/app.js          confirmations + live stat refresh + Running refresh
    tools/test-*.cjs       standalone tests (node tools/test-claude.cjs)

    deploy/moni-helper             privileged helper -> /usr/local/sbin/
    deploy/moni-agent@.service     systemd template, one instance per agent
    deploy/moni-dashboard.service  systemd unit for this panel
    deploy/nginx-moni.conf         nginx site
    deploy/moni-proxy-params       shared proxy headers
    deploy/moni-sudoers            the single-command sudo rule
    deploy/fail2ban-*.conf         filter and jail

## Deploying a change

    sudo bash /opt/moni-ai-os/deploy/deploy-dashboard.sh

It syntax-checks every file before restarting. Doing it by hand instead, always
`node --check` first — a syntax error otherwise leaves the service in a restart
loop with the panel down.

## Claude Code pages

OS Dashboard > Claude Code: **Memory** (`/claude/memory`), **Sessions**
(`/claude/sessions`), **Running** (`/claude/running`). Permissions
`claude.memory.read|write`, `claude.sessions.view|manage`,
`claude.running.view|stop` -- in no stock role, so administrator-only until a
role is given them: transcripts hold client data and the panel faces the
internet.

All data comes from the helper's `cc-*` subcommands. Memory reads and writes go
through memlib, run by the claude-memory venv inside the helper, so the database
credentials in `/root/.claude-memory/db.env` never reach this process. Output is
redacted by the helper (its own rules plus memlib's) and again by
`priv.redactDeep`. Nothing is deleted: editing a fact supersedes it, forgetting
is memlib's soft delete, archiving a session moves it to
`<home>/.claude/archive/dashboard-archived/`. Rename and archive are refused
while a session runs; Stop sends SIGINT only to a pid registered in a
`sessions/<pid>.json` whose process is the claude binary, and SIGTERM only 10 s
after that. Every write is in the audit log with the panel user.

Known follow-up: the memory search service on 127.0.0.1:8765 takes no token, so
any local process can query it. Adding one is deliberately left for later.
