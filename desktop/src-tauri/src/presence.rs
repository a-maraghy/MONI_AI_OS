//! Eye contact (2026-10-20; mockups/eye-contact/DESIGN.md): camera presence, the app's half -- pure, so
//! core-tests checks it on Linux. The camera is read by the site's page (dashboard/public/mint-presence.js,
//! a face model in the page; nothing leaves the computer); the app decides whether the page may have it:
//!
//!   - the WebView2 permission request: the camera only for the site, only while the setting is on
//!     (`permission`); never auto-granted otherwise, and nothing else new is granted;
//!   - the WebView2 profile's stored camera permission for the site follows the setting (`profile_state`):
//!     Deny while it is off (so a decision WebView2 kept from before can never let the camera open), Default
//!     while it is on (the request is raised and `permission` answers it);
//!   - the setting: off by default; the page may only switch things OFF (`page_set`); ON comes from the app's
//!     Settings window or the tray (a person at this computer), and the tray turns it on directly only once
//!     it was switched on in Settings before (`consented`, after reading the explanation there);
//!   - the page says when the camera is in use (the tray shows it); if the setting is off and the page still
//!     says so after a moment, the page is reloaded (`must_reload`) -- the camera cannot stay open by mistake.
