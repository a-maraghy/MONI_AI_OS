 * A recording in, what was said out -- or nothing. Shared by the Command
 * Center's direct path (/moni-ai/api/transcribe), the front desk
 * (/moni-ai/api/desk/turn) and the console's dictation, so none of them can
 * send a transcript the others would drop. See lib/voice-guard.js for why.
 *
 *   before OpenAI: a clip smaller than MIN_AUDIO_BYTES is not speech (a webm
 *                  header and a few frames); a clip the page measured as
 *                  shorter than MIN_SPEECH_MS, or with less than MIN_LOUD_MS
 *                  above its speech threshold, is not sent at all (nothing is
 *                  spent on it). Decoding opus here to measure the level would
 *                  need a codec; the page has the level already, and layers 2
 *                  and 3 hold without it.
 *   after OpenAI:  voice-guard.checkTranscript -- prompt echo, more words than
 *                  the audio holds, stock silence phrases on a short or quiet
 *                  clip.
 *
 * A drop is not an error: the caller answers as for silence ("didn't catch
 * that") and logs the rule, never the words.
