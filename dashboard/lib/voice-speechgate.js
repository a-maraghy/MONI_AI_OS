/**
 * The voiceprint in front of GPT-Live (2026-11-01; the administrator: "the voice print does not gate
 * speaking to gpt live"). GPT-Live hears the microphone and answers by itself, so the turn-level gate
 * (LiveCall.vpHold: nothing handed to MINT AI) came too late -- call lv1m3r7 rejected eleven turns of
 * another voice and GPT-Live still talked with it. Here the speech is checked BEFORE GPT-Live hears it:
 *
 *   idle       audio passes as it is; the room's floor is learned from quiet frames.
 *   holding    a frame of speech starts a segment: the audio is held until HOLD_SPEECH_MS of speech, a
 *              pause of END_GAP_MS, or MAX_HOLD_MS of audio. GPT-Live hears silence meanwhile, frame by
 *              frame: it only talks while it hears, so a gap in its input stalls its voice and the page
 *              runs dry (2026-11-01: "the voice keeps cutting" -- every segment while it talked was a gap).
 *   checking   the held audio goes to the voiceprint (lib/voiceprint.js check); still holding.
 *   open       a stored voice (accept, sticky), too short to tell (unverified), nothing stored or the
 *              service failing (fail open): the held audio is relayed at once, then the segment live.
 *              GPT-Live hears that speech up to MAX_HOLD_MS late, its input that much ahead of the clock.
 *   closed     an unknown voice (reject), two voices too close (uncertain), MINT AI's own (echo): GPT-Live
 *              goes on hearing silence, live, until the segment ends.
 *
 * A segment ends after END_GAP_MS without speech; the next speech is checked again.
