"""MCP server exposing one agent's memory vault to Claude.

Launched over stdio by the agent runtime, one process per agent, pointed at that
agent's vault and vector database by environment variables. An agent therefore
has no way to address another agent's memory: the isolation is in the process,
not in a parameter the model could get wrong.

    MONI_VAULT      path to the agent's Obsidian vault
    MONI_VECTOR_DB  path to that agent's vectors/memory.db

MEMORY.md is already injected into the system prompt on every request, so these
tools exist for what does not fit there: searching the long tail of notes, and
writing new ones durably.
