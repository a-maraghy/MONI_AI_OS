/**
 * Which queued turn MONI AI takes next.
 *
 * The supervisor used to write every queued turn straight into the CLI, which
 * runs them strictly in arrival order -- so a question the administrator
 * typed or spoke waited behind a watcher investigation or a standing order
 * (one voice turn waited 86 s behind a watcher turn). Now the supervisor
 * keeps the queue itself and hands the CLI one turn at a time, picking:
 *
 *   1. user turns -- whatever a panel user started: typed or spoken in the
 *      Command Center, the voice desk's hand-offs, mission requests, decision
 *      approvals and questions, a standing order run by hand;
 *   2. background turns -- watcher investigations and scheduled standing
 *      orders -- only when no user turn is waiting;
 *
 * first-in first-out within each class (by ledger id, which is arrival
 * order, so re-queued turns keep their place).
 *
 * Nothing is dropped, and nothing starves: a background turn that has waited
 * `maxWaitMs` is promoted and competes with user turns by arrival order.
 *
 * A running turn is never interrupted for a waiting one: an interrupted
 * investigation or order would lose its work and have to start again, and a
 * running turn may be holding an approval card. The user turn goes next.
