/**
 * What the live voice shares with the rest of the voice code: the output
 * guard, the fixed lines, the supervisor door, the snapshot filter, and the
 * guarded summary of MINT AI's replies.
 *
 * Until 2026-09-30 this was lib/voice-desk.js, the relay "front desk". The
 * desk was removed when voice became live conversation only (Mint OS
 * reorganisation); what the live call (lib/voice-live.js) still relies on
 * stayed here:
 *
 *   voiceOps(call, actor)  the only door to the supervisor: `snapshot` (read)
 *                          and `send` (via "voice-desk", the supervisor's
 *                          existing name for a voice hand-off) -- never
 *                          approve, deny, interrupt, rules or decisions; and
 *                          `send` refuses text that is an echo of a prompt
 *                          (lib/voice-guard.js);
 *   forModel(snap)         the read_status payload: counts and titles, no
 *                          command-like field, secrets redacted again;
 *   judge / guard / Releaser
 *                          the output guard. It cuts a claim that something
 *                          was done, deleted, restarted, pushed or approved (or
 *                          is being); a promise of one; a figure found neither
 *                          in the snapshot, nor in MINT AI's replies, nor in
 *                          what the administrator said; a status claim with no
 *                          snapshot behind it; "MINT AI said ..." (the voice IS
 *                          MINT AI, first person); "I'm checking" with nothing
 *                          being worked on. A summary is held to MINT AI's
 *                          reply: a figure changed, a negation flipped, a
 *                          recommendation it did not make, "I'll ask" turned
 *                          into "done", a name or a path it did not give -- each
 *                          is cut, and a pending approval that the summary left
 *                          out is said anyway. Every rule holds in Egyptian and
 *                          Modern Standard Arabic and in mixed sentences
 *                          (lib/voice-arabic.js), and fails closed;
 *   Summariser             a short spoken summary of one of MINT AI's replies,
 *                          written by a text-only realtime response
 *                          (SUMMARY_MODEL) and released sentence by sentence
 *                          through the guard; a short plain reply is read word
 *                          for word instead;
 *   linesFor / langOf      the fixed lines (first person, in the language of
 *                          the cut sentence, feminine / masculine / neutral in
 *                          Arabic after the persona).
 *
 * Cost: every summary's `usage` is priced (lib/voice-usage.js) and recorded by
 * the caller under the usage part "desk" (the summariser's text model; the
 * name is kept so older rows still add up).
 *
 * Everything runs on the server: the browser never talks to OpenAI and never
 * sees the key.
